## Description

This application was mainly created to review jQuery again because I have not used it in the past few projects and to try out SVG animations. It's an application that allows the user to search articles in the New York Times.

## Technologies Used

It's a front-end only application using the New York Times api, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and integrating SVG animations.

## Deployed Link

The deployed link to gh-pages: <a href="https://steffield.github.io/NYT-search--svg-practice">NYT SVG App</a>.
